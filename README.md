# Prototyping the Danebook Homepage

This project kicks off Week 1 of the [Viking Code School](http://www.vikingcodeschool.com).

## Project Requirements

The project is created using an Agile Development approach and managed with [a Pivotal Tracker project](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/s/projects/1149208).  To get started:

1. [fork this repository](https://github.com/vikingeducation/danebook_homepage) ([How to fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo)) to make a copy and then work locally with a clone of your fork.
2. Check out the [Pivotal Tracker Project](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/s/projects/1149208) to see the three stories for this project.  The Acceptance Criteria for each story is listed in the Tasks field.  The mockup is included as a comment on the Epic called "Homepage" (you might need to click the "Epics" tab to display the Epic... this will be along the top if you're using the old Tracker or along the left column if using the "Beta" version).  
3. Use the stories and their accompanying mockup to guide your development.  You'll start with the topmost story "Home Page", which will have you build the basic framework of the home page.  The following two stories will require you to add the forms for signing in and signing up.
3. Use Bootstrap and SASS to help produce these pages.  The standard Bootstrap style classes should get you some of the way there but you'll need to build an `overrides.css` or `styles.css` file of your own to augment them.
2. Once you've finished each story in the Pivotal Tracker (you don't need to manually check off the Acceptance Criteria / Tasks for this project), be sure to Git commit it.
4. When you're finished with all stories, submit your forked repository as a pull request to [this one](https://github.com/vikingeducation/danebook_homepage).  Each of your teammates will do the same with their own projects.

    1. Go to your fork and click the green "Pull Request" button:

    2. Examine the files that will be submitted.  If you don't see this screen, make sure you were actually on your fork in step 1:

    3. Title, add any clarifying comments, and submit your pull request:

3. Perform a code review on your assigned pair for the week by identifying that person's pull request on the Pull Requests tab and reviewing the files it contains.

4. Submit your review as [comments to the pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests#pull-request-discussion). 

## To Get Help

Ask your fellow teammates or the instructors for help if you need it.  Though this is intended as an individual project, you are more than welcome to collaborate as you see fit.
